# demo

## overview

**summary**  
apple once made a visual style of ads that had a colorful background with a black silohouette foreground, a dancer wearing an ipod that was shown in a white silohouette. creating a similar effect using the blazepose model is what this demo is about. the demo shows the subject of the video as a silohouette in the foreground, the background of the video as a solid color, and doesn't need to show any object like an ipod. the demo shows the result of applying the effect to videos of athletes doing handstands and other more impossible skills.
